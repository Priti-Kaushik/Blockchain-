The aggregate market capitalization to DEX (decentralized exchange) volume (ratio) refers to the ratio between the total value of all cryptocurrencies (market capitalization) and the trading volume happening on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). When this ratio is expressed as a 7-day moving average, it smooths out daily fluctuations by averaging the data over a week to provide a clearer long-term trend. Analyzing this over 24 months helps reveal how the relationship between market capitalization and trading volume has evolved.
